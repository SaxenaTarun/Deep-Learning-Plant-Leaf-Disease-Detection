Proposed AlexNet Model for Plant Leaf Detection 
In our research, we propose the modified AlexNet model pretrained on a dataset with 38 different classes of plant leaves and background images. After an extensive simulation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 97.66% for the aforementioned classification task for plant disease. Furthermore, the model is tested for better generalizability to achieve the consistency and reliability.
